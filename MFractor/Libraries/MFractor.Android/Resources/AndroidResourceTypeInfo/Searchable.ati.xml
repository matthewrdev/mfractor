			</ParameterValue>
			<ParameterValue Name="flagNavigatePrevious">
				<Description Locale="en" Content="Like flagNavigateNext, but specifies there is something interesting that a backward navigation can focus on.

Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_FULLSCREEN."/>
			</ParameterValue>
			<ParameterValue Name="flagNavigateNext">
				<Description Locale="en" Content="Used to specify that there is something interesting that a forward navigation can focus on. This is like using actionNext, except allows the IME to be multiline (with an enter key) as well as provide forward navigation. Note that some IMEs may not be able to do this, especially when running on a small screen where there is little space. In that case it does not need to present a UI for this option. Like actionNext, if the user selects the IME's facility to forward navigate, this will show up in the application at InputConnection.performEditorAction(int). Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NAVIGATE_NEXT."/>
			</ParameterValue>
			<ParameterValue Name="flagNoExtractUi">
				<Description Locale="en" Content="Used to specify that the IME does not need to show its extracted text UI. For input methods that may be fullscreen, often when in landscape mode, this allows them to be smaller and let part of the application be shown behind. Though there will likely be limited access to the application available from the user, it can make the experience of a (mostly) fullscreen IME less jarring. Note that when this flag is specified the IME may not be set up to be able to display text, so it should only be used in situations where this is not needed. Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_EXTRACT_UI."/>
			</ParameterValue>
			<ParameterValue Name="flagNoAccessoryAction">
				<Description Locale="en" Content="Used in conjunction with a custom action, this indicates that the action should not be available as an accessory button when the input method is full-screen. Note that by setting this flag, there can be cases where the action is simply never available to the user. Setting this generally means that you think showing text being edited is more important than the action you have supplied. Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_ACCESSORY_ACTION."/>
			</ParameterValue>
			<ParameterValue Name="flagNoEnterAction">
				<Description Locale="en" Content="Used in conjunction with a custom action, this indicates that the action should not be available in-line as a replacement for the 'enter' key. Typically this is because the action has such a significant impact or is not recoverable enough that accidentally hitting it should be avoided, such as sending a message. Note that TextView will automatically set this flag for you on multi-line text views. Corresponds to IME_FLAG_NO_ENTER_ACTION."/>
			</ParameterValue>
			<ParameterValue Name="flagForceAscii">
				<Description Locale="en" Content="Used to request that the IME should be capable of inputting ASCII characters. The intention of this flag is to ensure that the user can type Roman alphabet characters in a TextView used for, typically, account ID or password input. It is expected that IMEs normally are able to input ASCII even without being told so (such IMEs already respect this flag in a sense), but there could be some cases they aren't when, for instance, only non-ASCII input languagaes like Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Russian are enabled in the IME. Applications need to be aware that the flag is not a guarantee, and not all IMEs will respect it. However, it is strongly recommended for IME authors to respect this flag especially when their IME could end up with a state that has only non-ASCII input languages enabled. Corresponds to IME_FLAG_FORCE_ASCII."/>

		</Parameter>
		<Parameter Name="android:searchSuggestSelection" TypesCSV="string" Inputs="ValueOrReference" > 
			<Description Locale="en" Content="This value is passed into your query function as the selection parameter. Typically this is a WHERE clause for your database, and should contain a single question mark, which is a placeholder for the actual query string that has been typed by the user (for example, 'query=?'). However, you can also use any non-null value to trigger the delivery of the query text via the selectionArgs parameter (and then ignore the selection parameter)."/>

		<Parameter Name="android:searchSuggestIntentAction" TypesCSV="string" Inputs="ValueOrReference" > 
			<Description Locale="en" Content="The default intent action to be used when a user clicks on a custom search suggestion (such as 'android.intent.action.VIEW').

		</Parameter>
		<Parameter Name="android:searchSuggestIntentData" TypesCSV="string" Inputs="ValueOrReference" > 
			<Description Locale="en" Content="The default intent data to be used when a user clicks on a custom search suggestion.

		<Parameter Name="android:searchSuggestThreshold" TypesCSV="integer" Inputs="ValueOrReference" DefaultValue="0"> 
			<Description Locale="en" Content="The minimum number of characters needed to trigger a suggestion look-up. Only guarantees that the system will not query your content provider for anything shorter than the threshold. The default value is 0."/>

		<Parameter Name="android:includeInGlobalSearch" TypesCSV="boolean" Inputs="ValueOrReference"> 
			<Description Locale="en" Content="Required to provide search suggestions in Quick Search Box.) Set to 'true' if you want your suggestions to be included in the globally accessible Quick Search Box. The user must still enable your application as a searchable item in the system search settings before your suggestions will appear in Quick Search Box."/>

		<Parameter Name="android:searchSettingsDescription" TypesCSV="string" Inputs="ValueOrReference"> 
			<Description Locale="en" Content="Provides a brief description of the search suggestions that you provide to Quick Search Box, which is displayed in the searchable items entry for your application. Your description should concisely describe the content that is searchable. For example, 'Artists, albums, and tracks' for a music application, or 'Saved notes' for a notepad application."/>
		</Parameter>
		<Parameter Name="android:queryAfterZeroResults" TypesCSV="boolean" Inputs="ValueOrReference" DefaultValue="false"> 
			<Description Locale="en" Content="Set to 'true' if you want your content provider to be invoked for supersets of queries that have returned zero results in the past. For example, if your content provider returned zero results for 'bo', it should be requiried for 'bob'. If set to 'false', supersets are ignored for a single session ('bob' does not invoke a requery). This lasts only for the life of the search dialog or the life of the activity when using the search widget (when the search dialog or activity is reopened, 'bo' queries your content provider again). The default value is false."/>
		</Parameter>
		<Parameter Name="android:voiceSearchMode" TypesCSV="flag" Inputs="Value">

			<ParameterValue Name="showVoiceSearchButton">
				<Description Locale="en" Content="Display a voice search button, if voice search is available on the device. If set, then either 'launchWebSearch' or 'launchRecognizer' must also be set (separated by the pipe | character)."/>
			</ParameterValue>
			<ParameterValue Name="launchWebSearch">
				<Description Locale="en" Content="The voice search button takes the user directly to a built-in voice web search activity. Most applications don't need this flag, as it takes the user away from the activity in which search was invoked."/>
			</ParameterValue>
			<ParameterValue Name="launchRecognizer">
				<Description Locale="en" Content="The voice search button takes the user directly to a built-in voice recording activity. This activity prompts the user to speak, transcribes the spoken text, and forwards the resulting query text to the searchable activity, just as if the user typed it into the search UI and clicked the search button."/>
			</ParameterValue>

		</Parameter>
		<Node Name="actionkey" Abstract="false" Required="false">
			<Description Locale="en" Content="Defines a device key and behavior for a search action. A search action provides a special behavior at the touch of a button on the device, based on the current query or focused suggestion. For example, the Contacts application provides a search action to initiate a phone call to the currenly focused contact suggestion at the press of the CALL button. Not all action keys are available on every device, and not all keys are allowed to be overriden in this way. For example, the 'Home' key cannot be used and must always return to the home screen. Also be sure not to define an action key for a key that's needed for typing a search query. This essentially limits the available and reasonable action keys to the call button and menu button. Also note that action keys are not generally discoverable, so you should not provide them as a core user feature. You must define the android:keycode to define the key and at least one of the other three attributes in order to define the search action."/>
			<Parameter Name="android:keycode" RequirementBehaviour="Always" TypesCSV="string" Inputs="ValueOrReference">
				<Description Locale="en" Content="A key code from KeyEvent that represents the action key you wish to respond to (for example 'KEYCODE_CALL'). This is added to the ACTION_SEARCH intent that is passed to your searchable activity. To examine the key code, use getIntExtra(SearchManager.ACTION_KEY).

			</Parameter>
			<Parameter Name="android:queryActionMsg" TypesCSV="string" Inputs="ValueOrReference"> 
				<Description Locale="en" Content="An action message to be sent if the action key is pressed while the user is entering query text.

				<Description Locale="en" Content="An action message to be sent if the action key is pressed while a suggestion is in focus. This is added to the intent that the system passes to your searchable activity (using the action you've defined for the suggestion). To examine the string, use getStringExtra(SearchManager.ACTION_MSG). This should only be used if all your suggestions support this action key. If not all suggestions can handle the same action key, then you must instead use the following android:suggestActionMsgColumn attribute."/>
			</Parameter>
			<Parameter Name="android:suggestActionMsgColumn" TypesCSV="string" Inputs="ValueOrReference"> 
				<Description Locale="en" Content="The name of the column in your content provider that defines the action message for this action key, which is to be sent if the user presses the action key while a suggestion is in focus. This attribute lets you control the action key on a suggestion-by-suggestion basis, because, instead of using the android:suggestActionMsg attribute to define the action message for all suggestions, each entry in your content provider provides its own action message. First, you must define a column in your content provider for each suggestion to provide an action message, then provide the name of that column in this attribute. The system looks at your suggestion cursor, using the string provided here to select your action message column, and then select the action message string from the Cursor. That string is added to the intent that the system passes to your searchable activity (using the action you've defined for suggestions). To examine the string, use getStringExtra(SearchManager.ACTION_MSG). If the data does not exist for the selected suggestion, the action key is ignored."/>
